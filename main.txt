Application layer and transport layers
of a network are used by SOAP; HTTP
and SMTP are the valid protocol of
the application layer used as the
transport for SOAP. HTTP is more preferable,
since it works well with the current
Internet infrastructure, in particular
with firewalls.The SOAP requests can 
be sent using an HTTP GET method while
the specification only contains 
details about HTTP POST.
